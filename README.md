# Weather Alert

`weather_alert` is a project I built to send myself weather alerts from a gmail account to my cellphone 

### Why?

1. Sometimes I am blindsided by colder weather than expected or by precipitation. There are lots of apps and websites I could use actively to get weather reports, but this solution is more passive; I get a text every morning
2. This was a good opportunity to learn more about packages like smtplib, pyowm, and geopy
